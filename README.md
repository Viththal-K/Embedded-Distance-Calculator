# Distance Calculator using ARM Cortex-M4 based STM32F429I DISC Microcontroller
This project is a program for calculating the distance traveled by a person using the angular velocity outputs from the built-in gyroscope in an ARM Cortex-M4 based STM32F429I DISC microcontroller.

## Prerequisites
- Platform IO extension
- Embedded C
- Visual Studio Code
- STM32F429I DISC microcontroller

## Features
- Calculates the distance traveled based on the angular velocity outputs from the built-in gyroscope in the microcontroller.
- Utilizes Platform IO extension and embedded C to create and debug the program.
- Provides an accurate and reliable distance calculation.

## Installation
1. Install Platform IO extension in Visual Studio Code.
2. Install files required to connect to STM32F429I DISC microcontroller.

## Usage
1. Connect on the microcontroller to the computer.
2. Open the project files in Visual Studio Code
3. Run the program and observe the angular velocity outputs from the built-in gyroscope.
4. The program finally outputs the distance you moved.
